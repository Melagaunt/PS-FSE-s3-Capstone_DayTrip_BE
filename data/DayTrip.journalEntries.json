  "description": "Picture a vast expanse of water, islands so large they look like actual land masses, and river features that seem like still water with channels to fool even the most experienced river runner. A mellow Class I paddle can end up being a Class V challenge outside your skill level. I can only imagine what the first people to explore these rivers endured.",

  "description": "Perhaps our enthusiasm and motivation had been over-boosted by the lack of adventure this year and made us forget what paddling at 2000 meters of elevation in Colombia meant. The Rio Santo Domingo takes it source at above 3000 metres of elevation and cascades down the jungle covered mountains for over 1000 metres before it finally reaches a decent gradient.",
